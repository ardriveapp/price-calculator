		question: 'How much storage do I need?',
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					A little bit of money can go a long way in data storage. As
					you can see, a small amount of USD can purchase storage for
					thousands of documents or hundreds of photos or songs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Files of the same type (docs, jpegs, or mp3) will vary in
					sizes, but in general: 1 document 0.31 MB (320KB); 1 HD
					Photo 2.5 MB; 3.5 minute Song 3.5 MB; 1 minute HD video 100
					MB.
				</p>
			</>
		)
	},
	{
		question: 'How are fees calculated?',
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					The file size determines the fee to upload data to the
					network. The larger the file the higher the price will be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: All file sizes are represented using binary units of
					measurement (i.e. 1 MB = 1024 KB).
				</p>

	{
		question: 'What is AR?',
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					AR is the name of the cryptocurrency used to upload data
					onto the Arweave network. Similar to having to pay USD when
					in the United States, many blockchains have their own
					currency that you are required to use when you are in their
					‘land’. You have the option of paying for uploads using AR
					or you can use your credit card to purchase Credits to
					upload through ArDrive.

	},
	{
		question: 'What are Credits?',
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					Credits offers users the ability to pay via credit card
					instead of using the AR Token. Credits represent a 1:1 value
					with the AR Token, but are used solely to pay for uploads
					with ArDrive.

	},
	{
		question: 'Is the price of data consistent?',
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					Not exactly. The Arweave network protocol is always
					adjusting the data price to maintain sustainable, perpetual
					storage. The data price is lowered as the network increases
					its overall capacity.
				</p>
				<p>
					This can result in a fluctuating data price. However, for
					most files these fluctuations would only increase or
					decrease costs by fractions of a cent.
				</p>
			</>
		)
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I know how big a file is?',
		answer: (
			<p>
				In ArDrive, before any files are uploaded to the network, we
				calculate their size and estimate the price to upload. Before it
				is paid for and stored permanently, you must approve the upload.
				This ensures you are only uploading the right data for the right
				price.
			</p>

	},
	{
		question: 'How do I use a credit card?',
		answer: (
			<p>
				You can purchase Credits with your credit card in the web app
				from the profile menu.
